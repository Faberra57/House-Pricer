#My First Machine Learning Project

#Overview

I started learning Machine Learning with the book [‘Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow’]([URL](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/)) by Aurélien Géron. After reading this book, I wanted to implement what I learned, so I decided to participate in [this Kaggle competition]([URL](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)).

The competition involves predicting house prices based on 79 explanatory variables that describe almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.
