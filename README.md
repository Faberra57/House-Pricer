# My First Machine Learning Project

## Overview

I started learning Machine Learning with the book [‘Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow’](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) by Aurélien Géron. After reading this book, I wanted to implement what I learned, so I decided to participate in [this Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

The competition involves predicting house prices based on [79 explanatory variables](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) that describe almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

## Project Description

	- data_description : Dataset Description   .
	- house_pricing : Jupyter notebook for data exploration, analysis, data cleaning and model building.
    - train : data to train model
    - test : data to validate model
